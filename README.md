##PyDictionary Java

This is the source code of a client side implementation of the PyDictionary API in Java. This is my first serious project in Java aside from some Android Apps and the main purpose of this repo is for me to learn something new. 

I will hopefully learn packaging, HTTP requests and JSON encoding/decoding in Java which will help me in my java pursuits

###Dependencies

This project uses the simple JSON library for JSON manipulation in Java.
